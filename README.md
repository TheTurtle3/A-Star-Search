# A* Search Algorithm with Visual
## Background
This is a group project for Introduction to AI class. We were tasked with
creating a A* search algorithm that would traverse the graph to find the
“best” path (shortest distance or fewest nodes) from a selected starting node
to the goal node “O”. Extra credit for a visual implementation.
