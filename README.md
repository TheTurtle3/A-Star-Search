# A* Search Algorithm with Visual
## Background
This is a group project for Introduction to AI class. We were tasked with
creating a A* search algorithm that would traverse the graph to find the
“best” path (shortest distance or fewest nodes) from a selected starting node
to the goal node “O”. Extra credit for a visual implementation.

## How to Run
### Without Visual
Simply run the search.py file. This will create a maze-sol.txt file that
contains the solution based on choices the user makes during runtime.

### With Visual
Running the visual_search.py file requires the pygame library to be installed 
on the computer. This will also create a maze-sol.txt file that contains the 
solution based on choices the user makes during runtime. Additionally a window 
with the visual will also appear on screen.
